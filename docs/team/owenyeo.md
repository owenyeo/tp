**Enhancements implemented:**
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store user data, such as birthdays and schedules. It is stored in a Jackson file `userdata.json`
    * What it does: Allows the user to store their own data and schedules in TimetaBRO across sessions.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to quickly access their data and schedules should they need it, and allows for schedule comparisons to occur in other commands. Users also do not need to re-key their information every time they use the app.
    * Highlights: This enhancement required knowledge about Jackson files, and how to convert models into JSON adapted versions to save on a hard disk. It also required the implementation of a user class. It took me quite long for this.
* **New Feature**: Added ability to edit user data stored in the app itself.
    * What it does: Allows user to edit saved data straight from the app's CLI.
    * Justification: This makes the user experience a lot more smooth as the user does not need to access the `userdata.json` file to update their details.
    * Highlights: This enhancement required knowledge and tracing of the EditCommand to implement. This was relatively easier as we implemented a command in the codebase tutorial.
* **JsonAdapted classes**: Added JsonAdapted classes to translate models made by my team to Json friendly formats, and vice versa.
    * What it does: Allows user to store friends' and their own schedules and data in Json files.
    * Justification: This allows our new model, the schedule, and its related models to be able to be stored in a data.
    * Created the follow Json related classes:
        * JsonAdaptedCca
        * JsonAdaptedDatedEvent
        * JsonAdaptedModule
        * JsonAdaptedSchedule
        * JsonAdaptedUser
        * JsonUserDataStorage
        * JsonSerializableUserData
* Wrote testcases for storage
* **Modify person and AddressBook**: Disallowed duplicate phone numbers and emails. Changed notion of equality of same birthday AND same full name.
    * Justification: It is impossible for 2 different people to have the same phone number or the same email. It is also possible for people to have the same first name. Thus, adding birthday would mitigate this to a higher degree.
