## What is TimetaBRO?

TimetaBRO is a desktop application targetted at NUS students 
for storing and keeping track of your peers' schedules.

Created by NUS students, for NUS students, 
TimetaBRO aims to help you easily compare others' schedules with your own 
and efficiently find common free times with your friends or project group mates.

With TimetaBRO, forget hopping around screenshots of timetables to compare them, 
or wasting time going back and forth with your friends trying to find a meetup time!
Instead, store all your friend's timetables on one platform and save yourself from all the hassle. 
Schedule tracking and coordination has never been easier, faster, or more convenient!

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TimetaBRO_) used for finding meetup times.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TimetaBRO Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103T-w12-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the **[SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)**.
